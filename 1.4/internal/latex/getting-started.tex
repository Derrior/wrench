The first step is to install the W\+R\+E\+N\+CH library, following the instructions on the \hyperlink{install}{installation page}.\hypertarget{getting-started_getting-started-example}{}\section{Running a First Example}\label{getting-started_getting-started-example}
Typing {\ttfamily make} in the top-\/level directory will compile the examples, and {\ttfamily make install} will put the examples binaries in the {\ttfamily /usr/local/bin} folder (for Mac\+OS and most Linux distributions).

W\+R\+E\+N\+CH provides a simple example in the {\ttfamily examples/simple-\/example} directory, which generates two executables\+: a cloud-\/based example {\ttfamily wrench-\/simple-\/example-\/cloud}, and a batch-\/system-\/based (e.\+g., S\+L\+U\+RM) example {\ttfamily wrench-\/simple-\/example-\/batch}. To run the examples, simply use one of the following commands\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
# Runs the cloud-based implementation
wrench-simple-example-cloud \(\backslash\)
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/platform\_files/cloud\_hosts.xml \(\backslash\)
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/workflow\_files/genome.dax

# Runs the batch-based implementation
wrench-simple-example-batch \(\backslash\)
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/platform\_files/batch\_hosts.xml \(\backslash\)
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/workflow\_files/genome.dax
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{getting-started_getting-started-example-simple}{}\subsection{Understanding the Simple Example}\label{getting-started_getting-started-example-simple}
Both versions of the example (cloud of batch) require two command-\/line arguments\+: (1) a \href{http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.19/doc/platform.html}{\tt Sim\+Grid virtual platform description file}; and (2) a W\+R\+E\+N\+CH workflow file.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Sim\+Grid simulated platform description file\+:} A \href{http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr}{\tt Sim\+Grid} simulation must be provided with the description of the platform on which an application execution is to be simulated. This is done via a platform description file, in X\+ML, that includes definitions of compute hosts, clusters of hosts, storage resources, network links, routes between hosts, etc. A detailed description on how to create a platform description file can be found \href{http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.19/doc/platform.html}{\tt here}.
\item {\bfseries W\+R\+E\+N\+CH workflow file\+:} W\+R\+E\+N\+CH provides native parsers for \href{http://workflowarchive.org}{\tt D\+AX} (D\+AG in X\+ML) and \href{https://github.com/wrench-project/wrench/tree/master/doc/schemas}{\tt J\+S\+ON} workflow description file formats. Refer to their respective Web sites for detailed documentation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The source file for the cloud-\/based simulator is at {\ttfamily examples/simple-\/example/\+Simulator\+Cloud.\+cpp} and at {\ttfamily examples/simple-\/example/\+Simulator\+Batch.\+cpp} for the batch-\/based example. These source files, which are heavily commented, and perform the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The first step is to read and parse the workflow and the platform files, and to create a simulation object ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_simulation}{wrench\+::\+Simulation}}).
\item A storage service ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_simple_storage_service}{wrench\+::\+Simple\+Storage\+Service}}) is created and deployed on a host.
\item A cloud ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_cloud_service}{wrench\+::\+Cloud\+Service}}) or a batch ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_batch_service}{wrench\+::\+Batch\+Service}}) service is created and deployed on a host. Both services are seen by the simulation as compute services ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_compute_service}{wrench\+::\+Compute\+Service}}) â€“ jobs can then be submitted to these services.
\item A Workflow Management System ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_w_m_s}{wrench\+::\+W\+MS}}) is instantiated (in this case the {\ttfamily Simple\+W\+MS}) with a reference to a workflow object ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_workflow}{wrench\+::\+Workflow}}) and a scheduler ({\ttfamily wrench\+::\+Scheduler}). The scheduler implements the decision-\/making algorithms inside the W\+MS. These algorithms are modularized (so that the same W\+MS implementation can be iniated with various decision-\/making algorithms in different simulations). The source codes for the schedulers, which is of interest to \char`\"{}\+Developers\char`\"{} (i.\+e., those users who use the W\+R\+E\+N\+CH Developer A\+PI), is in directory {\ttfamily examples/scheduler}.
\item A file registry ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_file_registry_service}{wrench\+::\+File\+Registry\+Service}}), a.\+k.\+a. a file replica catalog, which keeps track of files stored in different storage services, is deployed on a host.
\item Workflow input files are staged on the storage service
\item The simulation is launched, executes, and completes.
\item Timestamps can be retrieved to analyze the simulated execution.

This simple example can be used as a blueprint for starting a large W\+R\+E\+N\+C\+H-\/based simulation project. The next section provides further details about this process.\hypertarget{getting-started_getting-started-prep}{}\section{Preparing the Environment}\label{getting-started_getting-started-prep}
Internal developers are expected to {\bfseries contribute} code to W\+R\+E\+N\+CH\textquotesingle{}s core components. Please, refer to the \href{./annotated.html}{\tt A\+PI Reference} to find the detailed documentation for W\+R\+E\+N\+CH functions.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries Note\+:} It is strongly recommended that W\+R\+E\+N\+CH internal developers (contributors) {\itshape fork} W\+R\+E\+N\+CH\textquotesingle{}s code from the \href{http://github.com/wrench-project/wrench}{\tt Git\+Hub repository}, and create pull requests with their proposed modifications. \end{quote}
