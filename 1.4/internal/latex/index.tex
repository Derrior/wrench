\href{http://wrench-project.org}{\tt W\+R\+E\+N\+CH} enables novel avenues for scientific workflow use, research, development, and education. W\+R\+E\+N\+CH capitalizes on recent and critical advances in the state of the art of distributed platform/application simulation. W\+R\+E\+N\+CH builds on top of the open-\/source \href{http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr}{\tt Sim\+Grid} simulation framework. Sim\+Grid enables the simulation of large-\/scale distributed applications in a way that is accurate (via validated simulation models), scalable (low ratio of simulation time to simulated time, ability to run large simulations on a single computer with low compute, memory, and energy footprints), and expressive (ability to simulate arbitrary platform, application, and execution scenarios). W\+R\+E\+N\+CH provides directly usable high-\/level simulation abstractions using Sim\+Grid as a foundation.

In a nutshell, W\+R\+E\+N\+CH makes it possible to\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Prototype implementations of Workflow Management System (W\+MS) components and underlying algorithms;
\item Quickly, scalably, and accurately simulate arbitrary workflow and platform scenarios for a simulated W\+MS implementation; and
\item Run extensive experimental campaigns to conclusively compare workflow executions, platform architectures, and W\+MS algorithms and designs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\hypertarget{index_overview-architecture}{}\section{Architecture}\label{index_overview-architecture}
W\+R\+E\+N\+CH is an {\itshape open-\/source library} for developing simulators. It is neither a graphical interface nor a stand-\/alone simulator. W\+R\+E\+N\+CH exposes several high-\/level simulation abstractions to provide high-\/level {\bfseries building blocks} for developing custom simulators.

W\+R\+E\+N\+CH comprises four distinct layers\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Simulation Core\+:} All necessary simulation models and base abstractions (computing, communicating, storing), provided by \href{http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr}{\tt Sim\+Grid}.
\item {\bfseries Simulated Core CI Services\+:} abstractions for simulated cyberinfrastructure (CI) components that can be used by a W\+MS to execute workflows (compute services, storage services, network proximity services, data location services, etc.).
\item {\bfseries Simulated W\+MS\+:} simulated W\+MS implementations (e.\+g., simulated existing production W\+M\+Ss, simulated W\+MS research prototypes).
\item {\bfseries Top-\/\+Level Simulation\+:} a top-\/level set of abstractions to instantiate and simulate the execution of arbitrary workflows on arbitrary platforms using a particular W\+MS implementation.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\hypertarget{index_overview-users}{}\section{Three Classes of Users}\label{index_overview-users}
W\+R\+E\+N\+CH is intended for three different classes of users\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries W\+MS Users} use W\+R\+E\+N\+CH to simulate workflow executions using already implemented W\+MS implementations and Core services.
\item {\bfseries W\+MS Developers/\+Researchers} use W\+R\+E\+N\+CH to prototype and evaluate software W\+MS designs and/or to investigate and evaluate novel algorithms to be implemented in W\+M\+Ss, or experimented in novel CI (interacting with already implemented Core Services).
\item {\bfseries Internal Developers} contribute to the W\+R\+E\+N\+CH code, and in particular, implement new Core Services.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_overview-users-levels}{}\subsection{Three Levels of A\+P\+I Documentation}\label{index_overview-users-levels}
The W\+R\+E\+N\+CH library provides three {\itshape incremental} levels of documentation, each targeting an A\+PI level\+:

{\bfseries User\+:} targets users who want to use W\+R\+E\+N\+CH for simulating the execution of scientific workflows in different simulation scenarios, using existing simulated W\+M\+Ss already implemented using W\+R\+E\+N\+CH. {\itshape Users} are N\+OT expected to develop new simulation abstractions or algorithms. Instead, they only use available simulation components as high-\/level building blocks to quickly build simulators. These simulators can be as simple as a single 50-\/line main() function. (\href{../user/index.html}{\tt See User Documentation})

{\bfseries Developer\+:} targets {\itshape W\+MS developers} and {\itshape W\+MS researchers} who work on developing novel W\+MS designs and algorithms. In addition to documentation for all simulation components provided at the {\itshape User} level, {\itshape Developer} documentation include detailed documentation for interacting with simulated Core Services. (\href{../developer/index.html}{\tt See Developer Documentation})

{\bfseries Internal\+:} targets those users who want to contribute code to W\+R\+E\+N\+CH. The {\itshape internal} documentation provides, in addition to both levels above, detailed documentation for all W\+R\+E\+N\+CH classes including binders to Sim\+Grid. This is the A\+PI needed to, for instance, implement new Core Services.\hypertarget{index_overview-contact}{}\section{Get in Touch}\label{index_overview-contact}
