W\+R\+E\+N\+CH 101 is a page and a set of documents that provide detailed information for each W\+R\+E\+N\+CH\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{index_overview-users}{classes of users}, and higher-\/level content than the \href{./annotated.html}{\tt A\+PI Reference}. For instructions on how to \hyperlink{install}{install}, run a \hyperlink{getting-started}{first example}, or \hyperlink{getting-started_getting-started-prep}{create a basic W\+R\+E\+N\+C\+H-\/based simulator}, please refer to their respective sections in the documentation.

This {\bfseries Internal 101} guide is intended for users who want to contribute code to W\+R\+E\+N\+CH to extend its capabilities. 



Make sure to read the \href{../user/wrench-101.html}{\tt User 101 Guide} and the \href{../developer/wrench-101.html}{\tt Developer 101 Guide} to understand how W\+R\+E\+N\+CH works from those perspectives. The largest portion of the W\+R\+E\+N\+CH code base is the \char`\"{}\+Internal\char`\"{} code base, and for now, the way to go is to look at the \href{./annotated.html}{\tt A\+PI Reference}. Do not hesitate to contact the W\+R\+E\+N\+CH team with questions about the internals of W\+R\+E\+N\+CH if you want to contribute. Of course, forking \href{http://github.com/wrench-project/wrench}{\tt The W\+R\+E\+N\+CH repository} and creating pull requests is the preferred way to contribute to W\+R\+E\+N\+CH as an Internal developer.

Here is a in-\/progress misc item list of interest\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Most (soon to be all) interaction with Sim\+Grid is done by the classes in the {\ttfamily src/simgrid\+\_\+\+S4\+U\+\_\+util} directory
\item A W\+R\+E\+N\+CH simulation, like any Sim\+Grid simulation, is comprised of simulated processes that communicate via messages with put/get-\/like operations into mailboxes. These processes are essentially implemented as threads, but they are not scheduled by the OS. Instead, they are scheduled by Sim\+Grid in round-\/robin fashion. Each thread runs without interruption in between two Sim\+Grid A\+PI calls. Therefore, although in principle W\+R\+E\+N\+CH is massively multi-\/threaded, there are {\itshape almost} no need for locks when sharing data among threads.
