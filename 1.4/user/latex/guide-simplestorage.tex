A Simple storage service is the simplest possible abstraction for a service that can store and provide workflow files. It has a certain storage capacity, and provides write, read, and delete operations on files. Writes and Reads can be done synchronously or asynchronously. In addition, higher-\/level semantics such as copying a file directly from a storage service to another are provided.\hypertarget{guide-simplestorage_guide-simplestorage-creating}{}\section{Creating a Simple storage service}\label{guide-simplestorage_guide-simplestorage-creating}
In W\+R\+E\+N\+CH, a Simple storage service represents a storage service ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_storage_service}{wrench\+::\+Storage\+Service}}), which is defined by the {\ttfamily wrench\+::\+Simple\+Storage} class. An instantiation of a Simple storage service requires the following parameters\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The name of a host on which to start the service (this is the entry point to the service);
\item A capacity in bytes;
\item Maps ({\ttfamily std\+::map}) of configurable properties ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_batch_service_property}{wrench\+::\+Batch\+Service\+Property}}) and configurable message payloads ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_batch_service_message_payload}{wrench\+::\+Batch\+Service\+Message\+Payload}}).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The example below shows how to create an instance of a Simple storage service that runs on host \char`\"{}\+Gateway\char`\"{}, has access to 64\+TiB of storage. Furthermore, the number of maximum concurrent data connections supported by the service is configured to be 8\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{auto} storage\_service = simulation->\hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_simulation_ad1f5c12285ecfaf5a2ce7dab5ec8b4c5}{add}(
          \textcolor{keyword}{new} \hyperlink{classwrench_1_1_simple_storage_service}{wrench::SimpleStorageService}(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"Gateway"}, 
                                  pow(2,46),
                                       \{\{wrench::SimpleStorageProperty::MAX\_NUM\_CONCURRENT\_DATA\_CONNECTIONS
      , \textcolor{stringliteral}{"8"}\}\}
                                      );
