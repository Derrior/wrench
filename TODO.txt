[DONE] Implement an ExecutionEvent class

- Make sure a Multicore Executor sends back "TASK_FAILED" message if it's stopped in the
  middle of running tasks

- Deal with error handling via nice exceptions, etc.

- Figure out how/whether to do asynchronous communication

- What happens if on stops a MulticoreExecutor while some jobs are running
    - Yet another "error" behavior

- Deal with failure traces...
