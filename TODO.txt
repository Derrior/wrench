------------------------------------

BUGS:

- After static optimizastion, the workflow has been changed, so user will be
  confused (not the same number of tasks!)
  SOLUTION:
    - Static optimizer does not modoify the DAG. Instead, it places tasks
      in StandardJobs, thus indicating which tasks should be done together
    - Then later, the WM will submit them together
    - We need to modify the "isReady()" method!


---------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES:

- Event Traces:
   - Define an enum per event type
   - Define a SimulationOutput object that cn be queried


- Deal with failure traces...
