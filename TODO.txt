BUGS:

    - There is a SegFault when exiting before simulation.launch() is executed.
        ("Invalid read of size 8" in smpi_process())
          Need to find good ways to cleanup stuff in S4U...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING:

- Create a "Service" base class, so as to avoid code duplication between
  StorageService,  ComputeService, FileRegistryService, etc.
    - Properties, however, need to be specific to each derived and twice-derived class...

- For the WMS, instead of having a bit switch to handle events, instead do a "listener" thing:
   A single method that says "waitForAndProcessNextEvent", that does the getMessage() and then
   calls user-provided "take action" methods, which are defined as virtual no-op methods in the base WMS class.

    - Plan a first paper [RAFAEL HENRI]

    - WRENCH in ICS632? [RAFAEL HENRI]
            - PMC?

    - Talk about another proposal? [RAFAEL HENRI]


* "EASY" implementation stuff

        [DONE] Add tests

        - Autogeneration of documentation on github

        [DONE] Event Traces: Template the TimeStamp class to afford genericity

        [DONE] Dynamic Optimization
            - Implement a naive one
            - Call it in right before scheduler

        [DONE] WorkflowTask:
            - add a failure count incremented for each failure

---------------------------------------------------------------------


* LYON:

    - Storage in S4U
        - What will it look like?
        - How to deal with pipelining of network/disk when remote put()/get()?
               - How does MSG do it?

    - Failures in S4U
        - Some way to do a "simcall_process_on_exit()"
            - Or catch some "process failure exception"?
        - Right now there is some uncaught exception in the maestro


    - General question: When will we get C++ Exceptions from SIMIX?

    - S4U: Kill() segfaults if actor has already terminated. Would it be
           possible to have some isAlive() method?  Or have kill() do a no-op if
           already dead?
