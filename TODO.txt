- Make put() asynchronous!

------------------------------------------------------------

WRENCH::Workflow
	- Implement a "create from DAX" method
	- Figure out whether tasks should specify flops or reference times
	   (right now, machines are specified as 1flop/sec, so #secs = #flops


WRENCH::ComputeService
    - finish a sequential executor implementation

simgrid_util:
    - Messages:
        - use a unique pointer to avoid new/delete

WRENCH::StorageService
    - implement it

Probably creates a WRENCH_Internal:: namespace so that users only see the WRENCH:: namespace? Standard in C++?
