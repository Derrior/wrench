DETAIL:
    - Is the UNSUPPORTED_JOB_TYPE Workflow Execution event useful since
      the submitJob() method throws an exception.... Or should it be
      part of the event flow? (I doubt it)

-----------------------------------

DATA STORAGE IMPLEMENTATION:

    - Decide what to do about "partial failures"
        - How do we report what has completed, and what hasn't upon failure


    - SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE: How to deal with synchrony problem
        - Wait for Mt to fix the wait_any()

    - Attach a default StorageService to the WMS??

    - Track all task change updates and make sure they're all in the JobManager...
        - They likely cannot, but the task life cycle is confusing right now

    - Chase memory leaks
        - CauseType/Exception unique_ptr?

------------------------------------

BUGS:

    - There is a SegFault when exiting before simulation.launch() is executed.
        ("Invalid read of size 8" in simix_process())
          Need to find good ways to cleanup stuff in S4U...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING:

- For the WMS, instead of having a big switch to handle events, instead do a "listener" thing:
   A single method that says "waitForAndProcessNextEvent", that does the getMessage() and then
   calls user-provided "take action" methods, which are defined as virtual no-op methods in the base WMS class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------


* "BIG" things:

    - All PIDs are zero

    - Plan a first paper
        - Workflow makespan prediction
            - Comparison WRENCH / WorkflowSim
                - Accuracy, Scalablity
                - Experiments training/eval  for WorkflowSim, WorkflowSim+Calibration, WRENCH, WRENCH+Calibration

    - WRENCH in ICS632?
            - Homework assignment: answer a few experimental questions as a WRENCH user
            - Project: write something in WRENCH

    - Talk about another proposal?
            - Main idea: "WRENCH enables WMS research, let's do research"

            - Interesting "Simulation" questions:
                   - Calibration of simulation is doable (develop generic calibrator)
                   - Overall tools for instantiating simulations
                   - Do tons of modeling/instantiation and validate
                   - Results: We have both the tool and the methodology to do "WMS science"
                   - Stochastic studies, sensitivity studies, impact of platform parameters...

            - WMS Research questions:

                   - Can we identify big problems with current designs?
                        - Perhaps when exploring upcoming Exascale scenarios

                   - Explore impact of WMS designs?   (EAGER?)

                   - Distributed WMS that partitions workflows on platforms?
                        - e.g., clouds?
                        - e.g., Exascale scenarios?

                   - Streaming vs. DAG, loops?
                        - Streaming has typical CMS questions inside (duplication)

                   - Workflow competition?
                        - What if everybody uses the same WMS?
                        - Is it worth deploying multiple kinds of WMS?
                        - very easy to study with WRENCH

                   - Map Reduce?

---------------------------------------------------------------------

* LYON:

    - Kill_all()
        - The processes doing a GET() seem to get a NULL messages
        - The processes doing a wait() seem to segfault

    - S4U: wait_any?  bug issued to github

    - Could we have a "get with timeout"?

    - Exiting before launch prints warning (as expected), but fails with a segfault
      when SMPI is enabled....

    - How to free memory for an actor that terminates...
            - When the actor sends a "I am done" message, one cannot free it then...
            - Or is it all taken care of by SimGrid?

    - S4U: Storage
        - What will it look like?
        - How to deal with pipelining of network/disk when remote putMessage()/getMessage()?
               - How does MSG do it?


    - S4U: When will we getMessage C++ Exceptions from SIMIX? (signal handler sucks)
        - Related: Actor throwing exception is not caught by launch()...

    - S4U: Kill() segfaults if s4u_actor has already terminated. Would it be
           possible to have some isAlive() method?  Or have kill() do a no-op if
           already dead?
