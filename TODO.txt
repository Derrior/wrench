- add an addWMS to the platform
- implemtn platform.shutdown()


Kill the services when destroying the platform (i.e., in its destructor)
  or in fact when to do it (to avoid the "deadlock" message)"?

    - Using MSG_process_kill?
    - Or sending a "nice" DAEMON_STOP message


Make a pass to do all shared_ptr / unique_ptr when needed.
Make a pass to deal with the destrictors.
valgrind it all

WRENCH::Workflow
	- Implement a "create from DAX" method

WRENCH::Platform
    - first version done. It does nothing, as it likely should

WRENCH::Simulation
    - first version done. It does very little, as it likely should

WRENCH::ComputeService
    - implemented a first version
            - Use unique_ptr to point to daemons
            - finish a sequential executor implementation

simgrid_util:
    - Imple,ent the messages and mailbox abstractions

WRENCH::StorageService
    - implement it


Probably creates a WRENCH_Internal:: namespace so that users only see the WRENCH:: namespace? Standard in C++?
