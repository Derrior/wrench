------------------------------------

- Right now, the "killbox" stuff inside the stop() method of compute services is not great
	- But we need an ack to make sure memory doesn't get freed before a daemon has
          completely shutdownAllComputeServices

PilotJob:
	- Remaining bug to fix: when a pilot job terminates it should notify the
          containing ComputeService AS WELL AS THE JOB MANAGER




---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Deal with error handling via nice exceptions, etc.

- Deal with failure traces...

- Should ComputeService->runJob() do the "can run" check?

- Dealing with removing "friend class" with Visitor pattern:
