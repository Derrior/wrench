------------------------------------

- Right now, the "killbox" stuff inside the stop() method of compute services is not great
	- But we need an ack to make sure memory doesn't get freed before a daemon has
          completely shutdownAllComputeServices



---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Deal with configuration of various delays for ComputeServices
	- Pass an Array of poperties key-value pairs to createComputeService?
	        simulation->createComputeService(hostname, {{"s1","v1"}, {"s2", "v2"}})

- Deal with error handling via nice exceptions, etc.

- Deal with failure traces...
