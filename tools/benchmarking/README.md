# Toolkit for measuring instance performance on your particular workflow

## How to use
You need description of your workflow in dax format and list of input files in pegasus format. For example, such description for Montage workflow is generated by this project.

* Run `get_all_input.py`, giving two arguments -- folder to download files and resource list (in example project above it is `data/rc.txt`)
* Run `runner.py`. This script will run sequentially all jobs in workflow, measuring execution time. You can specify number of runs, folder with binaries, folder with input files.
* If you have several instances with same configuration, and you want to join their measurements, use `join_benchmark_result.py`.
* This format can be easily parsed, but if you use python3, you can use `benchmark_io.py` as library, which can read from such format.

## Dependencies
Here's the sweet part -- it works from scratch with any python3, no external libs needed.
